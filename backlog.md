1. [Fitting custom mixture models](https://github.com/drcwadaniels/mouse-topographic-withholding/blob/main/TopographyTRModel.md) to reveal nuanced behavioral fluctuations sensitive to different schedules of reinforcement that require response withholding as well as sensitivity to reducing motivation; all in service of a paper not yet published but tentatively titled: **Response-Inhibition Capacity of Mice is Differentially Modulated by Response Topography in Two Response-Withholding Tasks** 
2. [Pushing the limits of Scalar Invariant timing](https://github.com/drcwadaniels/variance_cyclic_timing) to determine whether time perception is scalar invariant in dynamic environments; all in service of a paper not yet published but tentatively titled: **Tracking of Sinusoidal Time is Not Scalar Invariant**
3. [Reanalyzing my dissertation with Bayesian Statistical Models](https://github.com/drcwadaniels/ResponseInitiationDissertation) to make the analysis of my yet-to-be-published dissertation more cohesive between Switch-Timing and Temporal Bisection. Unfortunately since I only have access to my linux laptop for running these large models it will take sometime. Nonetheless, check it out and hopefully soon there will be paper titled: **Response-Initiation Differentially Affects Explicit and Implicit Switch Timing**

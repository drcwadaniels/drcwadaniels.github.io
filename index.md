# Brief Biography:

Hi! I'm Carter W. Daniels, Ph.D. I was born and raised in Lexington, KY along with my fraternal twin brother [Joe Daniels](https://www.joeadaniels.com/?fbclid=IwAR0GLdCzlIzDi4W49y7MdAPdjK7QAWvLSe8i03U4FeSQC6URh5mh-xYd-2U) (he has a PhD in Geography and is a great photographer). After finishing my bachelors education at the University of Kentucky where I completed a senior thesis with [Dr. Thomas Zentall](https://psychology.as.uky.edu/users/zentall), I briefly backpacked around Iceland before starting graduate school at Arizona State University under the mentorship of [Dr. Federico Sanabria](https://psychology.asu.edu/research/labs/basic-behavioral-processes-lab-sanabria). Though I researched many topics--cementing my penchant for research ADHD--I completed my masters on computational and my dissertation on procedural dissociations of motivation and time perception. After finishing graduate school, I briefly lived in Madagascar with my wife [Katharine Thompson](https://www.katharine-thompson.com) (an amazing scientist and illustrator completing her PhD in Medical Anthropology this May 2022) before a stint as a post-doc under the mentorship of [Dr. Peter Balsam](http://dept.psych.columbia.edu/balsam/). 

In October 2021, I made the difficult but boon of a decision to leave academia and enter industry with the official title of Quantitative Scientist. I think it nicely encompasses my jack-of-all-trades approach to science. Since getting settled I've decided to rework this website to focus on projects presented as Jupyter Lab or R Notebooks (more than likely a combination of both). Most of these will be working through my backlog of data from graduate school and my post-doc. Other times I may dabble in some webscraping or playing around with other data sets to try out something from machine learning, etc. You will also find poetry I've dabbled in. Nonetheless, please enjoy!

# Brief Biography:

Hi! I'm Carter W. Daniels, Ph.D. Currently, I am a T32 Post-doctoral Fellow in Schizophrenia Research at Columbia University; I also TA (and sometimes guest lecture) at Barnard College. A little bit about me and my on-going journey. I was born and raised in Lexington, KY along with my fraternal twin brother Joe Daniels (he is also working on his PhD in Geography and is a great photographer, learn more about him [here](https://www.joeadaniels.com/?fbclid=IwAR0GLdCzlIzDi4W49y7MdAPdjK7QAWvLSe8i03U4FeSQC6URh5mh-xYd-2U)). After finishing my bachelors education at the University of Kentucky I briefly backpacked around Iceland before starting graduate school at Arizona State University under the mentorship of Dr. Federico Sanabria. Though I researched many topics--cementing my penchant for research ADHD--I completed my masters on computational and my dissertation on procedural dissociations of motivation and time perception. After finishing graduate school I briefly lived in Madagascar with my wife Katharine Thompson (an amazing scientist and illustrator completing her PhD in Medical Anthropology, learn more about her [here](https://katharine-thompson.com/)) before starting at my current position. This website is meant to showcase my academic work and my hobbies. Enjoy!

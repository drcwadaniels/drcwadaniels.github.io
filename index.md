## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Hi! I'm Dr. Carter W. Daniels. Currently, I am a T32 Post-doctoral Fellow in Schizophrenia Research at Columbia University; I also TA (and sometimes guest lecture) at Barnard College. A little bit about me and my on-going journey. I was born and raised in Lexington, KY. After finishing my bachelors education at the University of Kentucky I briefly backpacked around Iceland before starting graduate school at Arizona State University under the mentorship of Dr. Federico Sanabria. Though I researched many topics--cementing my penchant for research ADHD--I completed my masters on computational and my dissertation on procedural dissociations of motivation and time perception. After finishing graduate school I briefly lived in Madagascar with my wife Katharine Thompson (an amazing scientist and illustrator completing her PhD in Medical Anthropology) before starting at my current position. This website is meant to showcase my academic work and my hobbies. Enjoy!

# Brief Biography:

Hi! I'm Carter W. Daniels, Ph.D. I was born and raised in Lexington, KY along with my fraternal twin brother [Joe Daniels](https://www.joeadaniels.com/?fbclid=IwAR0GLdCzlIzDi4W49y7MdAPdjK7QAWvLSe8i03U4FeSQC6URh5mh-xYd-2U) (he has a PhD in Geography and is a great photographer). After finishing my bachelors education at the University of Kentucky where I completed a senior thesis with [Dr. Thomas Zentall](https://psychology.as.uky.edu/users/zentall), I briefly backpacked around Iceland before starting graduate school at Arizona State University under the mentorship of [Dr. Federico Sanabria](https://psychology.asu.edu/research/labs/basic-behavioral-processes-lab). Though I researched many topics--cementing my penchant for research ADHD--I completed my masters on computational and my dissertation on procedural dissociations of motivation and time perception. After finishing graduate school, I briefly lived in Madagascar with my wife [Katharine Thompson](https://www.katharine-thompson.com) (an amazing scientist and illustrator who earned her PhD in Anthropology in May 2022) before completing a post-doc under the mentorship of [Dr. Peter Balsam](https://psychology.columbia.edu/content/peter-balsam) and [Dr. Eleanor Simpson](https://www.columbiapsychiatry.org/profile/eleanor-simpson-phd). Currently, I am a Quantitiative Scientist at Eli Lilly doing my best to bring all of my knowledge and skills to bear on developing gene therapies for genetically-associated neural disorders. I mostly design studies and do stats, paying close attention to how the stats connects the behavior and neuroscience.

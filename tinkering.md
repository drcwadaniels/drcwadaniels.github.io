1. [A STEAM webscraper](https://github.com/drcwadaniels/steamraces) now deprecated and never finished; but was fun to play with; it created a SQL dB from which graphs were automatically generated 
2. [Build a SQL dB](https://github.com/drcwadaniels/TDTPhotometrySQLdbBuilder) from photometric data collected in vivio!

# Is this the code you're looking for?
Most recent update: 4/29/2021 @ 1:00am

I am unfortunately **VERY** behind on updating this section of my website. If you're looking for code related to published scientific work, for now, please see my [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/rvbd6/) profile. As I move forward in my career I will update this as I publish papers and slowly work through my backlog. 

If, on the other hand, you're looking for personal projects. I have finally committed to doing some non-work related coding. 
1. I've tried my hand at my first [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/carterdaniels/predicting-heart-disease), predicting whether someone has heart disease. Overall a logistic regression did a decent job, with a hit and correct rejection rate of about ~80% and a miss and false alarm rate < 20%. 
2. A Photometry SQL dB Constructor! [Repository](https://github.com/drcwadaniels/TDTPhotometrySQLdbBuilder) <- a semi-automated python script for processing and storing photometry data in an SQL dB. 
3. Steam Races! [Repository](https://github.com/drcwadaniels/steamraces) <- A simple webscraper for looking at hour-by-hour player statistics

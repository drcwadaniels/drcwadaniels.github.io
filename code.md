# Is this the code you're looking for?
Most recent update: 3/8/2021

I am unfortunately **VERY** behind on updating this section of my website. If you're looking for code, for now, please see my [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/rvbd6/) profile. As I move forward in my career I will update this as I publish papers and slowly work through my backlog.

# Is this the code you're looking for?
Most recent update: 4/16/2021 @ 9:53pm

I am unfortunately **VERY** behind on updating this section of my website. If you're looking for code related to published scientific work, for now, please see my [Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/rvbd6/) profile. As I move forward in my career I will update this as I publish papers and slowly work through my backlog. 

If, on the other hand, you're looking for personal projects. I have finally committed to doing some non-work related coding.

Most recent: 2/3/2021 @ 11:49pm

1. Updated CV portion of website to better reflect most recent conferences and where papers have been submitted and/or accepted. 
2. First pre-print up from my post-doc is up! Enjoy [learning](https://psyarxiv.com/bzu4y) about the composition of acquisition and how its affected by prior experience. 
3. Finally! A new update. It has been a rather busy year what with the birth of my daughter and trying to make headway learning technical skills to advance my work beyond behavior and into neuroscience. Although I have struggled to keep up a good publishing pace, I finally debuted some data I've been slowly working through in my post-doc at the Pavlovian Society which you can also take a [peak at](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FJZ87). Hopefully the pre-print isn't too far behind.
4. Version 1.0 of the website was completed @ 10:26 pm on 5/25/2020. This version of the website contains some of my CV, my instagram feed, a short biography, and pages dedicated to coding and writing. Hereafter, the website will be updated with code and writing, and when a publication or scientific proceeding occurs the CV.

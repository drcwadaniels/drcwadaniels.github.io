1.Finally! A new update. It has been a rather busy year what with the birth of my daughter and trying to make headway learning technical skills to advance my work beyond behavior and into neuroscience. Although I have struggled to keep up a good publishing pace, I finally debuted some data I've been slowly working through in my post-doc at the Pavlovian Society which you can also take a peak at<https://osf.io/fj26q/>. Hopefully the pre-print isn't too far behind.
2. Version 1.0 of the website was completed @ 10:26 pm on 5/25/2020. This version of the website contains some of my CV, my instagram feed, a short biography, and pages dedicated to coding and writing. Hereafter, the website will be updated with code and writing, and when a publication or scientific proceeding occurs the CV.

# Updates!
Most recent: 4/27/2021 @ 4:27pm

1. [Coding](code.md) page has been updated with a link and short description of my first Kaggle notebook. 
2. I've released some code in the hopes that it helps people manage their photometry data. See the [coding page](code.md) for more information. 
3. I have committed to doing some non-work coding projects. See the [coding page](code.md) for more information, the first project is Steam Races!
4. A new paper is published. Some exiciting work in which I got to collaborate on; one of my first real neuroscience studies. Very happy to be co-author revealing how hyperactive MEK1 signaling affects behavioral inhibition in [mice](https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhaa413/6132785?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
5. Updated CV portion of website to better reflect most recent conferences and where papers have been submitted and/or accepted. 
6. First pre-print up from my post-doc is up! Enjoy [learning](https://psyarxiv.com/bzu4y) about the composition of acquisition and how its affected by prior experience. 
7. Finally! A new update. It has been a rather busy year what with the birth of my daughter and trying to make headway learning technical skills to advance my work beyond behavior and into neuroscience. Although I have struggled to keep up a good publishing pace, I finally debuted some data I've been slowly working through in my post-doc at the Pavlovian Society which you can also take a [peak at](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/FJZ87). Hopefully the pre-print isn't too far behind.
8. Version 1.0 of the website was completed @ 10:26 pm on 5/25/2020. This version of the website contains some of my CV, my instagram feed, a short biography, and pages dedicated to coding and writing. Hereafter, the website will be updated with code and writing, and when a publication or scientific proceeding occurs the CV.
